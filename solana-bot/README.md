# Solana Trading Bot

I am most proud of this project. The **Solana Trading Bot** is a production-grade, fully automated trading system built specifically for the Solana blockchain. It seamlessly integrates every aspect of algorithmic trading—from data ingestion and strategy execution to risk management and real-time monitoring—all while leveraging Solana's high-performance network.

## Overview

The Solana Trading Bot automates every facet of the trading process, including:

- **Data Ingestion:** Combines both historical and real-time market data for comprehensive analysis.
- **Strategy Engine:** Supports backtesting and live execution using customizable strategies (e.g., RSI Momentum).
- **Execution Engine:** Creates and submits orders with robust error handling and integrated MEV protection via Jito.
- **Risk Management:** Implements position sizing, stop-loss/take-profit triggers, and exposure control.
- **Wallet & Authentication:** Securely manages wallet keys and transaction signing.
- **Monitoring & Alerts:** Provides real-time performance metrics and automated alerting using Prometheus.

Installation

Prerequisites
	•	Docker (or Python 3.9+ for local development)
	•	Git

Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/jadenfix/solanatools.git
cd solanatools/solana-bot

Dockerized Setup
	1.	Build the Docker image:

docker build -t solana-bot .


	2.	Run unit tests inside the container:

docker run --rm solana-bot


	3.	Run the Bot (Dry-Run or Live Trading):

docker run --rm solana-bot python main.py --dry-run



Local Setup
	1.	Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	2.	Run the Bot:

python main.py



Usage

Before running the bot, configure your wallet and environment settings by editing the files in the config/ directory or setting appropriate environment variables. For live trading, ensure you have connected to the correct Solana RPC endpoints and provided your Jito MEV protection keys.
