## Overview

I work on a collection of projects that leverage the Solana blockchain for algorithmic trading and portfolio management. While I enjoy experimenting with various platforms, my primary focus is the **Solana Trading Bot**â€”a fully automated trading system designed for the Solana blockchain. This bot integrates data ingestion, strategy execution, risk management, and real-time monitoring in a modular, automated approach.

## Projects

### âš¡ Solana Trading Bot ([solana-bot](https://github.com/jadenfix/solanatools/tree/main/solana-bot))
*The main project and focus*

The **Solana Trading Bot** is built for the Solana blockchain and automates many aspects of trading, including:
- **Data Ingestion:** Combining historical and real-time market data.
- **Strategy Engine:** Supporting both backtesting and live execution (for example, using an RSI Momentum strategy).
- **Execution Engine:** Submitting orders with error handling and MEV protection via Jito.
- **Risk Management:** Managing exposure with stop-loss and take-profit triggers.
- **Wallet & Authentication:** Securely handling wallet keys and transaction signing.
- **Monitoring & Alerts:** Providing real-time performance metrics and automated alerts via Prometheus.

For more details on its architecture, project structure, and key features, please visit the [solana-bot directory](https://github.com/jadenfix/solanatools/tree/main/solana-bot).

### ðŸ§ª Strategy Backtesting ([backteststrats.ipynb](https://github.com/jadenfix/solanatools/blob/main/backteststrats.ipynb))
*A framework for quantitative analysis of Solana alternative coins*

```python
# RSI-based trading strategy example
class MemeCoinStrategy(Strategy):
    def init(self):
        self.rsi = self.I(RSI, self.data.Close, 14)
        self.vol_ma = self.I(lambda v: v.rolling(24).mean(), self.data.Volume)
    
    def next(self):
        if self.rsi[-1] < 30 and self.data.Volume[-1] > 1.5 * self.vol_ma[-1]:
            self.buy()
        elif self.rsi[-1] > 70:
            self.sell()
```
Features:
	â€¢	Uses historical OHLCV data from the Helius API
	â€¢	Parameter optimization through grid search
	â€¢	Models commission and slippage
	â€¢	Provides performance metrics (e.g., Sharpe ratio, max drawdown)

Why Iâ€™m Proud of the Solana Trading Bot

While I continue to explore various projects on the Solana blockchain, the Solana Trading Bot remains the project I am most passionate about. It embodies years of learning in algorithmic trading and blockchain technology. Its automated, modular design and comprehensive risk management make it a project I am proud to share with the community.
